# Sensor-Moitoring-System-
A Python-based real-time sensor monitoring system that reads environmental data such as temperature and humidity, logs it to CSV, visualizes the data using graphs, and prepares for PDF report generation. This project is designed to support offline environments, making it suitable for industrial use cases where internet connectivity is limited.
